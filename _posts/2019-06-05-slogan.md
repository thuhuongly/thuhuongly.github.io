Remember the days when I was 11-12 years old, after taking a shower, I always stood in front of the mirror in the bathroom which was blurred by the mist. I wrote 2 lines on the mirror: "If I want, I will win. I will win if I want." Those two lines kept nurturing my dream, my motivation to try my best through all the hard times as a teenager. (I stopped writing those lines when I came to high school and I don't remember why.)  
Sometimes if you want to achieve something and there is no one there to encourage you, just be there for yourself. Be 100% there to motivate yourself. That was what the little stubborn me did for the current me and today I'm very grateful for what she did :smiley:
