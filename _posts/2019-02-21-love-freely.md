When I told my ex that I love him, he said: "No, you don't love me". I was angry. It's my feelings, my emotions. My immediate reaction at that moment was to ask him: "How can you be so sure about it?" But I didn't. I choose to look deeply. I was always jealous and felt insecure. Where do all those feelings come from? I don't know. I grew up with them. They can come from the unhappy marriage of my grandparents (no betrayal, just misunderstanding). They can come from the environment I grew up in, from the media, from friends, from my own past relationship...  
It was my habit that everytime I had those feelings I tried to put them on my partner. I blamed him. I tried to take control in the relationship. I blamed myself. It's like building a prison for you and your partner. A prison in the name of love and responsibility. You know, that kind of relationship is full of tiredness. For yourself, for your loved one...  
So now I choose to take care of them - my jealousy and insecurity.  
I recognize them every time they come. I embrace them, give them my warm hug. When I'm angry with my loved one, I breathe and be silent. I know I can't love anyone if I don't know how to love myself.  
I let both of us be free.  
No more possession.  
I give him what I have and accept what he can give :blush:
